# FCP 10: PC Card Deprecation Notice

PC Card has not been relevant in years. It's inclusion in the tree is holding us back.

## Problem Statement

PC Card used to be very relevant. However, the only reason we have a
number of really old network drivers is due to PC Card. If we were to
remove it, many of them could be deleted. PC Card is a 16-bit only
standard. Most relevant hardware that FreeBSD runs on has CardBus
slots, and the 32-bit PCI cards are still well supported.

There's little enough traffic on CardBus cards in the mobile mailing
list, and none for PC Cards in many years.

## Proposed Solution

We will remove PC Card from the tree. We will also remove drivers that are
only in the tree for PC Card support, and all the PC Card attachments.

The unforunately named /etc/pccard_ether, run when a network card is
inserted into the system, will remain a quaint anachronism.

PC Card is supported on i386, amd64 and Power PC.

The following drivers will have their PC Card attachemnt removed:
	an, ata, ed, fdc, puc, sio, uart, wi

The following drivers will be deleted:
	cmx, ep, ex, fe, ncv, nsp, pccard, sn, stg, xe, bt3c

## Proposed Timeline

August 2018 Add deprecation notices to the pccard bridge code before the 12.0 release
August 2018 Post to mobile@ and arch@ plans to remove things, point them at this draft
November 2018 Remove PC Card from -current. Remove PC Card attachments. Remove all drivers
	that are PC Card only.

## Final Disposition
